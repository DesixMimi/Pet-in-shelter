# The future of pets who find themselves in shelters

As part of a "intro to data science" course, me and my partner had to choose a subject that we care about and intrested to investigate.
The subject we chose is **Pets in shelters**.
Due to the pandemic, there have been a drastic raise in the addoption rate, and due to that we tried solve the next subjects:
1. Predicting petsâ€™ stay in shelter
2. Finding the main causes for pets' abandonment 
3. Finding the ratio between intakes and outtakes of shelters 

*With the hope of being able to gain some insights and maybe being able to prevent it in the future*.

### What is inside the project:
Inside this project you'll find the next files:
1. A PowerPoint presentation - it contains a full explanation to the whole proccess.
2. Dataset.
3. Cleaning Data, incomes&outcomes - refers to the whole dataset
4. Outcomes(only) Data cleaning - refers only to the data regarding the pets who left the shelter (their outcome).
5. 4 additional ipynb files containing 3 different ML models used to predict and classify:
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
